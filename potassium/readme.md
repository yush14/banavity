    Learned how to use DJango using LinkedInLearning, provided free from my university. Learned how interactions with the web call methods in DJango, and how to create apps, display webpages, and run the server. I was able to display front-end done by the front-end team, locally on my device. 

    Some Commands:
        django-admin startproject smartnotes . 
         - Starts the DJango project
         - pre-formats a lot of code

        python3 manage.py runserver  
         - Makes the server live, locally
         - hosted at local address

        django-admin startapp index
         - Makes a new app website to display content
         - Can make any number of these
