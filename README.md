This is the current README.md and file state for the banavity project! The goal of this software is to create a platform for education and professional usage to simply solve complex physics problems through interactive representation of systems. Throughout the project's development this will be frequently updated to convey both the project's goal and progress.

Banavity is inspired by a Virginia Tech student named Nathan Rand who was frustrated with the lack of online calculators for physics students, and he wanted to make a difference. He, and his band of friends, Riley, Nolan, Marl, Sarah, and Will, go on an adventure to change the world of physics students forever. This japanese-inspired animated cinematic tells their story.
